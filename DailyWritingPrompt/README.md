# Daily Writing Prompt

Daily Writing Prompt is an app to help writers build the daily habit of writing something creative.

Perfect for when you just wake up and are lazing in bed with phone in hand!

## More Info

This is my final app for Udacity's Android Kotlin Developer course. I will develop it in accordance
with the requirements as outlined in their rubric.

Daily Writing Prompt is an app to give writers something to write about every day for a few minutes.
The app will give the user an image pulled from the internet (not sure where yet) as well
as one interesting word/topic/phrase (not sure if I can pull these from online or if I
need to make up my own database). The user can shake the phone up to 3 times to "refresh" the
prompt if they are not feeling motivated by what they've been given. After the prompt is locked in,
user is given the option to write for 1, 3, or 5 minutes. There's also the option to put in any
amount of time they want.

When the timer starts, the user writes for the allotted time until they are done. When the timer
finishes, the full text the user just wrote is saved to a list along with date and time, word count,
the image/word prompt, and amount of time they chose to write with. User will have the option to
share to social media as an image screenshot of the text. Making the design of the app look nice
would definitely be a plus here!

## Other features

* Daily notification that reminds the user that it's time to write.
* A brief tutorial of how the app works should be shown to first-time users.
* Would be nice to animate the timer as a circle so the user can see how much time has elapsed
  and get a better visual of how much time they have left.
* A bonus could be having a calendar screen that indicates which days they've written on. This way
  they can keep track of their daily progress and help form the habit of daily writing.
